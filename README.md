Introduction to “Do We Know Our Sun and Its Origin?”
Many astrophysicists today teach that the Sun consists mostly of hydrogen, and that its primary energy source is hydrogen fusion via quantum tunneling. But have you ever doubted this explanation?
Consider this: the Sun is filled with hydrogen, and each fusion reaction releases much more energy than the energy required to overcome the fusion barrier. This raises a serious question—if conditions inside the Sun can support hydrogen fusion, what prevents a chain reaction that leads to a massive explosion? After 4.6 billion years, the Sun has not exploded. With an estimated 200 billion trillion stars in the observable universe, why don’t we observe stars exploding every second?
Back in 1981, while I was conducting graduate research at the University of Missouri–Rolla (UMR), my advisor, Dr. Oliver Manuel—Chairman of the Chemistry Department—asked me to model the Sun with 0.5% iron in the core. After two weeks of deep thought and calculations, I came back to him with an unexpected conclusion: the Sun is not composed mostly of hydrogen, and hydrogen fusion is not the main energy source of the Sun. I presented four arguments that convinced him. He then encouraged me to model the Sun’s core with 80% iron and 20% silicon.
That same year, I wrote a paper titled “Another View of the Sun.” It was not Dr. Manuel who taught me to challenge scientific authorities; rather, he admired that I already had the courage to do so. He told new graduates: “A good scientist must have the courage to challenge established views when the evidence leads elsewhere. Golden is a good example.”
Later, in 2009, I wrote a new paper titled “Do We Know Our Sun and Its Origin?” In it, I present my analysis of the Sun’s true composition and energy source, based on both scientific reasoning and the foundational ideas of my Scientific Life Theory. I invite you to read this paper with a critical and open mind—because science advances when we dare to ask the questions others overlook.
